# Overall Workflow Review

## Workflow Structure Analysis

The workflow follows a linear progression:

1. **1-1-create-task.md** → Create local task draft
2. **1-2-sync_tasks.md** → Sync with GitHub Issues
3. **2-design.md** → Create design documentation
4. **3-implement.md** → Implement based on design
5. **4-create-pr.md** → Create and manage PR

## Strengths

1. **Clear Progression**: The numbered files make the workflow order obvious
2. **State Tracking**: Uses both local YAML files and GitHub labels for state
3. **Bi-directional Sync**: Can work with both local drafts and existing GitHub issues
4. **Design-First Approach**: Encourages thinking through design before implementation

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Workflow Components**

- **No Initial Setup/Onboarding**: How to configure the workflow initially
- **No Testing Phase**: Between implementation and PR
- **No Post-Merge Cleanup**: What happens after PR is merged
- **No Rollback/Cancel Procedures**: How to abandon or restart a task

### 2. **State Management Complexity**

- Six states (Backlog, Design, Dev, Review, Done, IceBox) but IceBox is never used
- State transitions are not clearly documented
- No state diagram or visual representation
- Files are renamed when state changes, making tracking difficult

### 3. **Tool Permission Gaps**

- Commands need Write/MultiEdit tools but only have Bash
- This forces awkward file creation through echo/cat
- No access to code analysis or testing tools

### 4. **Error Handling and Recovery**

- Most commands exit on error with no recovery path
- No validation before state transitions
- No way to handle partial failures

### 5. **Language and Documentation**

- Mixed English/Japanese makes it less accessible
- "ultrathink" concept introduced but not explained
- No examples of actual implementation

## Recommendations for New Workflow Files

### 1. **0-setup.md** - Initial Configuration

```yaml
---
description: Initialize the workflow environment and configuration
allowed-tools: Bash(*), Write, Read
---
Steps:
  - Create necessary directories (tasks/, tasks/design/, tasks/pr/)
  - Validate GitHub authentication
  - Set up git hooks for commit message validation
  - Create .claude/workflow.config with settings
```

### 2. **3.5-test.md** - Testing Phase

```yaml
---
description: Run tests and quality checks before creating PR
allowed-tools: Bash(*), Read
---
Steps:
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration tests
  - Check code coverage
  - Run linting and formatting
  - Update task with test results
```

### 3. **5-merge-cleanup.md** - Post-Merge Actions

```yaml
---
description: Clean up after successful PR merge
allowed-tools: Bash(*), Write
---
Steps:
  - Archive task files to tasks/completed/
  - Close GitHub issue
  - Delete local and remote feature branches
  - Update project documentation if needed
```

### 4. **workflow-status.md** - Check Workflow Status

```yaml
---
description: Show current state of all tasks in the workflow
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(*)
---
Output:
  - Tasks in each state
  - Stuck/abandoned tasks
  - Tasks needing attention
  - Workflow health metrics
```

## Workflow Best Practices to Add

### 1. **State Transition Rules**

Create a clear state machine:

```
Backlog → Design → Dev → Review → Done
           ↓        ↓       ↓
        IceBox   Backlog  Dev (for fixes)
```

### 2. **File Naming Convention**

Instead of renaming files, keep consistent names and track state internally:

```
tasks/{ID}.yaml (never renamed)
tasks/design/{ID}.md
tasks/pr/{ID}.md
tasks/pr/{ID}_review.md
```

### 3. **Validation Gates**

Before each state transition:

- Validate required fields are present
- Check dependencies are met
- Confirm user wants to proceed

### 4. **Batch Operations**

Add support for:

- Multiple issue handling in one command
- Bulk state transitions
- Parallel PR creation

### 5. **Progress Tracking**

- Add timestamps for each state transition
- Track cycle time metrics
- Generate workflow reports

## Configuration File Suggestion

Create `.claude/workflow.config`:

```yaml
workflow:
  states:
    - name: Backlog
      next: [Design, IceBox]
    - name: Design
      next: [Dev, Backlog]
    - name: Dev
      next: [Review, Design]
    - name: Review
      next: [Done, Dev]
    - name: Done
      next: []
    - name: IceBox
      next: [Backlog]

  types:
    - Task
    - Feature
    - Bug

  settings:
    auto_push: false
    require_tests: true
    delete_branches_after_merge: true
    archive_completed_tasks: true
```

## Summary

The workflow has a solid foundation but needs:

1. Better error handling and recovery procedures
2. Clearer documentation and examples
3. Additional workflow steps for testing and cleanup
4. Simplified state management
5. Proper tooling permissions
6. Configuration management

These improvements would make the workflow more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.
